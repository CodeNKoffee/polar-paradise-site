This separation will help:

1. Keep marketplace users focused on the theme features
2. Give developers clear technical information for contributing to the website
3. Maintain appropriate context for each platform
4. Allow for platform-specific instructions and requirements

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or help create the website's technical README?
